My first custom PCB design for Tech-Diya using KiCad 9.0
# 🔌 My First PCB Design – KiCad Journey Begins

This repository contains my **first-ever PCB design**, created using **KiCad** 🎉.  
It was a fun and foundational experience exploring the world of PCB design — from schematics to layout.  
While this board is *functionally complete* and includes all the necessary files, it is **not yet fully optimized** in terms of routing, layout, and component choice.

## ⚠️ Note
> **This design is not intended for real-world printing (yet).**  
> Although it includes Gerber files and looks "print-ready", it should be considered **hypothetical** at this stage.  
> Future revisions will focus on:
> - Design rule optimization  
> - Component placement improvements  
> - Manufacturability enhancements
