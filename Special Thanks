🙏 Special Thanks
I want to express my deepest gratitude to PCB Cupid for being the guiding light in my PCB design journey. 🌟

This project marks a huge personal milestone — my first-ever PCB design — and it simply wouldn't have been possible without the clear, patient, and beginner-friendly tutorials from PCB Cupid. What once seemed like a complex and intimidating task became a fun, fulfilling learning experience because of his content.

This design is heavily inspired by his original work. I recreated it solely for educational purposes, to understand and appreciate the process involved. All design rights rightfully belong to him, and I acknowledge his creativity and hard work with full respect. 🙌

From being completely new to KiCad to building a print-ready board, your videos made the journey possible. Thank you for empowering learners like me! 💖
